# Team Efficiency

**Objective: Improve Customer Happiness or Net Promoter Score (NPS)**

Actively listen to customer feedback, identify and address pain points, particularly for "detractor" customers, prioritize excellent customer service throughout the entire customer journey, and implement changes based on feedback to create a positive experience that encourages customer loyalty and advocacy

Efficiency isn't just about delivering featuresâ€”itâ€™s about delivering quality. If our time is spent fixing bugs instead of developing new features and improving DevOps, we aren't truly efficient.

Bugs and unhandled logic errors negatively impact customer experience, damage our team's reputation, and create doubts among top-level management and clients.

Traditionally, our goal has been to complete tasks and mark them as 100% done. However, we must prioritize end-user satisfactionâ€”customers dislike waiting and despise bugs. Working on level 4-5 projects requires a new mindset:

*The goal is no longer just delivering code; the goal is delivering a stable, bug-free product.*

## Goal: Enhance Code Quality, Minimize Bugs, and Improve Customer Experience

ðŸ“Œ Best Practices to Implement Immediately

Below are some actions you can do now which will eventually lead to a much less buggy application. Even if you have automated testing in place, these items below are still required and have high importance. 

##### Read each item, ponder, digest, and implement. 

#### 1. Communicate Effectively
- Seek help and feedback from your manager/supervisor or team members.
- Clarify any uncertaintiesâ€”donâ€™t assume anything when coding.

#### 2. Plan Before You Code
- For new features or major revisions, if ever you have blockers or stuck you may create a flowchart.
- Get approval from your supervisor before proceeding.
- Map out logic in advance to catch potential loopholes.

#### 3. Submit Code in Small, Manageable Changes
- For bug fixes and feature improvements, keep changes minimal.
- Submit Pull Requests (PRs) as soon as possibleâ€”avoid bulk PRs.

#### 4. Take Ownership of Production Code
- Once code is deployed, it becomes a team responsibility.
- If a bug is reported, donâ€™t ignore it just because it wasnâ€™t your codeâ€”adopt a team-first mindset.

#### 5. Review Data Along with Code
- Many bugs originate from incorrect database management.
- Ensure data consistency and integrity when making changes.

#### 6. Managers: Own the Project
- Every bug or customer concern falls under your responsibility.
- Your priority is getting issues fixed, either by delegating or resolving them yourself.

#### 7. Fix Bugs Permanently
- Avoid temporary fixes that only address a single customerâ€™s issue.
- If a hotfix is necessary, ensure a long-term fix is planned and prioritized.

#### 8. Address Production Errors Logged in Jira.
- Any error in Jira indicates something is wrong.
- If an issue is occurring repeatedly for customers, it needs immediate attention.

#### 9. Test Your Code On You Local First
- Before submitting a pull request (PR), always test your code thoroughly on your local environment to ensure it functions as expected.
- To prevent conflicts, update your branch with the latest changes from the staging or production branch. This helps keep your codebase up to date and aligned with the team's workflow.
- If conflicts arise, resolve them immediately and re-test your features to confirm they work correctly after the merge.
- Regularly pulling updates and testing locally minimizes issues during code reviews and deployments, ensuring a smoother development process.

#### 10. Understand the Features You're Implementing or Testing
- As a team member, it's essential to have a clear understanding of how a feature works, including its purpose, functionality, and expected behavior.
- Actively engage with your teammatesâ€”ask questions, seek clarifications, and maintain open communication. This ensures you gain the necessary knowledge and guidance to effectively implement or test the feature.
- Collaborate closely with others to share insights and best practices, fostering a smooth workflow and improving overall team efficiency.

#### 11. UI/UX Collaboration and Best Practices
- As a team, we may hold meetings to ensure the proper implementation of UI/UX, aligning with best practices and user expectations.
- Actively participate by sharing your insights, suggestions, and feedback to improve the overall design and usability of the product.
- Keep user needs and user pain points in mind and be open to constructive feedback to enhance the visual appeal and functionality of the interface.

## Immediate Action Plan
For projects with active customers, resolving bugs and logged errors is a top priority. Fix issues before they accumulate. Detailed prioritization guidelines will be shared next week, but until then, teams are expected to take initiative and resolve reported issues promptly by following the guidelines above.
