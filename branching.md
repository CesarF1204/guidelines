# Skillura Branching Instructions

## Backend:
1. Fork the main or master branch of the repository (ex. Skillura's backend git repository). 
2. Create and go to your preferred folder (eg. skillura). Open a terminal under that folder and type `git init` then clone your local repository for backend afterwards.
    ```
    git init
    ```
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/011-skillura-backend.git
    ```
3. Go to the cloned folder (011-skillura-backend) and add local remote repository. In your terminal, type:
    ```
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/011-skillura-backend.git
    ``` 
    Change `your-username` to your github username.
    <br>
    This will be your local remote repository

4. Add skillura remote repository. In your terminal, type:
    ```
    git remote add skillura_be https://github.com/AAA-Software/011-skillura-backend.git
    ```
    This will be the backend remote repository
5. Check if origin and skillura_be is added.
    ```
    git remote -v
    ```

## Frontend:
1. Fork the main or master branch of the repository (ex. Skillura's frontend git repository). 
2. Go to skillura folder that you created then clone your local repository for frontend afterwards.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/011-skillura-frontend.git
    ```
3. Go to the cloned folder (011-skillura-frontend) and add local remote repository. In your terminal, type:
    ```
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/011-skillura-frontend.git
    ``` 
    Change `your-username` to your github username.
    <br>
    This will be your local remote repository

4. Add skillura remote repository. In your terminal, type:
    ```
    git remote add skillura_fe https://github.com/AAA-Software/011-skillura-backend.git
    ```
    This will be the frontend remote repository
5. Check if origin and skillura_fe is added.
    ```
    git remote -v
    ```

*If no error, and you have checked that the origin, skillura_be, and skillura_fe is added. Then, you may proceed with:*
<br>

### Using git fetch
- This command downloads changes from the remote repository (e.g., GitHub) but does not merge them into your local branch.
- It updates your local references to the remote branches.
- Useful when you want to check for updates before merging.
    ```
    git fetch skillura_be
    ```
    *(This fetches updates from the skillura_be remote repository but does not apply them to your local branch.)*

### Using git pull
- It fetches updates from the remote repository and immediately merges them into your current local branch.
- If there are conflicts, Git will ask you to resolve them.
- This command is essentially git fetch + git merge.
    ```
    git pull skillura_be
    ```
    *(This fetches and merges changes from the skillura_be remote repository into your current branch.)*

    If you want to pull an specific branch from skillura_be remote repository. You can also use:
    ```
    git pull skillura_be staging
    ```

### Using git merge
- This command merges changes from one branch into another.
    ```
    git merge skillura_be/staging
    ```
    *(This merges changes from the remote staging branch into your current branch.)*


### Copying remote branch to your local branch
- Create first a branch that will be used for requesting a PR.
    1. You should be on staging or production branch. On this tutorial I'll use staging branch.

    2. Then click on the branches selection. Type your specified branch name. Then click the "Create Branch [your-specified branch name]"

    3. After creating a branch on the skillura remote repository. You may proceed to copying that remote branch to your local branch. Go your your terminal and type:
        - Use `git checkout -b [your-branch-local-repo] [remote-name/remote-branch-repo]`
            ```
            git checkout -b fix/SK-9999-login-issue skillura_be/fix/SK-9999-login-issue
            ```
    4. And you're done! You have created your local branch that is based on the remote branch. You may start fixing the issue. Push it when you're finish and request a PR on the remote branch.

### ðŸ“ŒNote: When working on a new feature or fixing bugs, use the following branch naming convention:

- For new feature: `feature/[jira-ticket-id]-short-description`
- For fixes: `fix/[jira-ticket-id]-short-description`
- For hotfixes: `hotfix/[jira-ticket-id]-short-description`

## Proposed Git Workflow for Issue Resolution and Deployment:

### 1. Create a Local Branch
- Copy the remote branch (sk-9999) containing the issue to a local branch (sk-9999-local).

### 2. Sync with Production
- Update the local branch with the latest changes from the remote production branch to ensure the fix is applied to the most recent version.

### 3. Apply Fixes and Push Changes
- Implement the necessary fixes and push the changes to the local branch.
- Create a Pull Request (PR) to merge sk-9999-local into sk-9999.

### 4. Code Review & Approval
- A manager or an authorized reviewer checks the PR and reviews the code changes in sk-9999.

### 5. Merge to Issue Branch (sk-9999)
- After the code review is completed, an authorized person merges the PR into sk-9999.

### 6. Prepare for Staging Deployment
- Once sk-9999 has the updated fix, a PR is created to merge sk-9999 into the staging branch.
- Do not merge immediatelyâ€”another round of code review is required to check for conflicts or additional issues.

### 7. Merge to Staging
- If no issues are found during the second review, the PR is approved, and sk-9999 is merged into staging.

### 8. Deploy to Staging Server
- The staging site is updated with the latest fixes.

### 9. QA Testing
- The QA team tests the staging site for any new issues.
- If issues are found, a new ticket is created to Jira, and the cycle repeats.

### 10. Schedule Production Release
- The manager schedules the release, typically on a predefined deployment day (e.g., Monday).
- He/she will make a PR from the staging branch to production branch. But before merging it, a final review is performed to check for conflicts.

### 11. Merge to Production
- If no conflicts or issues are found, the staging branch is merged into production.

### 12. Deploy to Production Server
- The production site will now be updated with the latest fixes, new features, and hotfixes.

This structured workflow ensures a smooth process from issue resolution to deployment, with multiple review checkpoints to maintain code quality and stability.
